        "\n",
        "In a day and age where advertisements are being fed to consumers everywhere, using humour and familiar media in marketing can help attrat hard to reach customers. One of the more recent forms of humourous marketing is meme marketing. Memes originally 'represented the idea of \"going viral\" within a biological system or society' (McCrae, 2019) and was coined by the author and biologist Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book 'The Selfish Gene'. In Dawkin's book, a 'meme' referred to the way an idea spreads from person to person within society. Today, memes usually come in the form of media or text as a way to \"reflect on current events, clich√©s and trends\" (Whitman, 2019). Memes usually created and spread on social media platforms including Facebook, Instagram, Reddit and Twitter. For advertising and marketing companies it is important to know which memes are and will be popular as it extremely effective to leverage meme media as a way to boost brand exposure and engage new customers. This report will go over the challenges in predicting whether a twitter message will spread as a meme or not as well as existing approaches."

        "# Challenges\n",
        "\n",
        "There are many challenges when it comes to predicting whether a twitter message will spread as a meme or not. One notable issue that arises when attempting to predict potential meme virality is the differences in user behaviours and characteristics (Yang, Sun, Zhang and Mei, 2012). If one were to predict meme virality based on these metrics, there would be many false positives due to specific invidual interests. To remedy this issue, Weng et al. (2013) designs \"network communities\" to predict viral memes. Network communities are groups of individuals with similar interests and behaviours. These communities are more susceptible to adopting a meme as are affected by \"homophilly\" which is created through sharing interests.\n"

        "Although meme marketing has only recently become a hot topic, there are many different approaches to determine and predict whether a twitter post will become viral or not. Two of these approaches are a time series analysis and a feature-based classification. \n",
        "\n",
        "Time series analysis, focuses on the variations in the level of popularity during the early stages of a meme. This approach assumes the growth and decay of popularity at these stages will reflect whether or not it will be popular in the future. \n",
        "\n",
        "Feature-based classification, focuses to discover attributes of previously viral memes and attempts to find similarities to determine and predict whether the meme will spread. This approach was used by Weng et al. (2014) by \"applying supervised machine learning techniques with labelled datasets\".\n",
        "\n",

        "To validate these approaches, a historical evaluation should be taken to measure their accuracy at a basic level. To evaluate historically, a training and testing dataset should be created. Using previously popular memes derived from Twitter messages and non-viral messages, the model should be tested to see if it is able to properrly classify those that would eventually become 'viral' and those that would not. This could then be matched into a confusion matrix as accuracy rates and false positives may be biased if used directly."

        "\n",
        "The ability to predict and determine if a Twitter message will become a meme can have many impacts ethically and on society. In today's day and age where consumers skip advertisements whenever they can, marketers and advertisers are spending more to reach out to their audience. If they were able to predict whether a Twitter message will become a meme and also reverse engineer the attributes that make a 'successful' meme, then it is possible that for a brief moment, they are able to manipulate and change consumer's thought processes via social media. Another consequence of this study is the ability to create and categorize \"Network Communities\" of people who are not 'fit' and 'wanted' in society based on their interests or behaviour. This would provide a more transparent view for agencies into our personal and private lives which is a great social impact."

        "Although there are many challenges when attempting to determine or predict whether a Twitter message will become a meme or not, it is certainly possible to use predict if a meme will go viral. Using the previously stated approaches which have also been tested by Weng et al., one can predict virality by using time series analysis or feature-based classification. Time series analysis, aims to determine if a meme will go viral based on its growth and decay during its earlier stages whilst feature-based classification attempts to extract 'successful' attributes from previously viral memes and finds similarities to predict virality."
