        "In a day and age where advertisements are being fed to consumers everywhere, using humour and familiar media in marketing can help attrat hard to reach customers. One of the more recent forms of humourous marketing is meme marketing. Memes originally 'represented the idea of \"going viral\" within a biological system or society' (McCrae, 2019) and was coined by the author and biologist Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book 'The Selfish Gene'. In Dawkin's book, a 'meme' referred to the way an idea spreads from person to person within society. Today, memes usually come in the form of media or text as a way to \"reflect on current events, clich√©s and trends\" (Whitman, 2019). Memes usually created and spread on social media platforms including Facebook, Instagram, Reddit and Twitter. For advertising and marketing companies it is important to know which memes are and will be popular as it extremely effective to leverage meme media as a way to boost brand exposure and engage new customers. This report will go over the challenges in predicting whether a twitter message will spread as a meme or not as well as existing approaches."

        "# Challenges\n",
        "\n",
        "There are many challenges when it comes to predicting whether a twitter message will spread as a meme or not. One notable issue that arises when attempting to predict potential meme virality is the differences in user behaviours and characteristics (Yang, Sun, Zhang and Mei, 2012). If one were to predict meme virality based on these metrics, there would be many false positives due to specific invidual interests. To remedy this issue, Weng et al. (2013) designs \"network communities\" to predict viral memes. Network communities are groups of individuals with similar interests and behaviours. These communities are more susceptible to adopting a meme as are affected by \"homophilly\" which is created through sharing interests.\n"

        "Although meme marketing has only recently become a hot topic, there are many reports on trying to successfully predict viral memes and their approaches. In one study, Weng et al. (2014) utilized two approaches: a time series analysis and a feature-based classification. \n",
        "\n",
        "Time series analysis, focuses on the variations in the level of popularity during the early stages of a meme. This approach assumes the growth and decay of popularity at these stages will reflect whether or not it will be popular in the future. \n",
        "\n",
        "Feature-based classification, focuses to discover attributes of previously viral memes and attempts to find similarities to determine and predict whether the meme will spread. This approach was used by Weng et al. (2014) by \"applying supervised machine learning techniques with labelled datasets\"."
