        "In a day and age where advertisements are being fed to consumers everywhere, using humour and familiar media in marketing can help attrat hard to reach customers. One of the more recent forms of humourous marketing is meme marketing. Memes originally 'represented the idea of \"going viral\" within a biological system or society' (McCrae, 2019) and was coined by the author and biologist Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book 'The Selfish Gene'. In Dawkin's book, a 'meme' referred to the way an idea spreads from person to person within society. Today, memes usually come in the form of media as a way to \"reflect on current events, clich√©s and trends\" (Whitman, 2019). Memes usually created and spread on social media platforms including Facebook, Instagram, Reddit and Twitter. For advertising and marketing companies it is important to know which memes are and will be popular as it extremely effective to leverage meme media as a way to boost brand exposure and engage new customers. This report will go over the challenges in predicting whether a twitter message will spread as a meme or not as well as existing approaches."
